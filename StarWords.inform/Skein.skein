Yoda strikes like a viper while seeming to hover outside your range.
Yoda says &quot;Ready are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained. A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh. Excitement. Heh. A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless.&quot;

A bounty hunter circles you, pointing a shock rifle and a bounty blaster.

Looks like the clone warrior is taking this personally.

The clone warrior attacks you with the laser rifle, causing 1 point of damage!

The bounty hunter attacks you with the shock rifle, finishing you off!
